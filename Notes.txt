Class 1 -

Mobile testing - only UI (front-end) is change, rest layers will be same for testing.
companies prefer virtual devices over real  devices because they are dedicated for testing activities.
we will execute our scripts on andriod phones because apple doesn't allow to create iphone devices using windows.

open the android studio -
file = new project > empty activity > phone and tablet > next > finish.

the first function of android studio is to generate virutal devies

android studio gives you sdk, this sdk is responsible for automation of mobile scripts

we have added the android sdk path in user variables
and tools, platform tools and emulator path in path extended variable
(in case if you don't have tool folder in sdk, go to android studio> tools>sdk manager>hide obsolete package>install it)


device manager - it allows user to create emulator/simulator for testing purpose

to check, if android sdk is installed or not - type adb in terminal
adb devices - to check the list and id of the devices which are active

android studio is installed and set
appium server is downloaded
device is created

.apk is the extension for android
.app/.asi is the extension for ios

here, we get .apk/.app from the developers and we install it in our simulators instead of just url because it is an app

command for getting the device id -
adb devices

to get the app package and app activity,
we need to open the cmd where the apk file exist
and then we have to type
adb shell
dumpsys window | grep -E 'mCurrentFocus'


Class 2 -

we have added 5 dependencies in our framework -
2 cucumber-java-junit
2 appium and selenium
1 apache poi ooxml

do we need main folder?
no

under test - we have 2 branches
java and resources

we have created utils, steps, runners and pages packages in java
we have created features and config directory in resources

we have written a scenario, created step definition and
passed the path of it in runner class

before running the script, make sure
device is open
appium server should be running
correct capabilities should be passed

one login scenario for successful login
setup the method to launch the android device and the application in it
created the basic skeleton of the framework


ui automator viewer
it is available in android sdk path
it is a batch file having .bat extension

we obtain the screenshot using ui automator viewer
we rely on resource id, content desc, text, index value for mobile elements


//*[@id='voa']
//*[@content-desc='voa']
//*[@text='vot']
//*[@index='3']



class 3 -
recap -

ui automator viewer for identifying the mobile elements in the application
common locators in appium - resource id, content desc, index, text etc.

desired capabilities and appium url address

apk and device related information - device version, platform, name, app package, app activity etc
127.0.0.1:4723/wd/hub

appium driver we use instead of web driver because we are working with mobile

- valid login scenario in swaglabs application
- apk is available in our project itself
- in feature file, we wrote a scenario for login
- in steps def, we kept steps for the scenario
- in pages package, we have all the object repository and methods
